Coming to my projects I had involved in 3 projects....my current project is Admiral Insurance System this application used to process and settle claims raised by registered customers.
When registered customers have an incident in which the vehicle is damaged or people are injured, then they lodge a claim. As per the terms of the insurance contract, money needs to be paid to reimburse part or full loss sustained due to the incident. Incidents can be part damage, theft or total loss to the vehicle. 
If the vehicle is damaged and it can be repaired, then to verify the extent of damage and the amount that can be paid, details of the incident are entered in different screens of AIS.
The application allows faster processing, tracking and settlement of claims. Since it is a web based application, authorized users from any geographical location with the required access rights can view or
